# Color Guessing Game

### Object of the game...
When the page loads it will display the RGB values on the top of the screen. The first number will be RED, the second number will be GREEN, and the third number will be BLUE. 

The RGB scale starts at "0" and ends at "255". The lower the number the less amount of that color is used.

Guess which colored square matches the RGB code correctly and you win!
